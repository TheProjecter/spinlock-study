= Project email, IM, GUI wiki editor =

Hey Trevor. Question: does google code have an internal project email and IM system? It would be good to be able to send/receive emails, IMs and have the system archive them for future searching and persual as is possible in svn repos like Assembla. Also, is there a GUI wiki editor (would be nice but not neccessary)?. Also, I don't see an option to here that enables one to attach and link documents/files to a wiki page.

= C++ mess =
I've got the Java project going. The C++ project blew up in my face. I am using the cygwin c++,gdb,make etc... What is g++-4 ? I tried replacing it with just g++ (in the make file) but then it couldn't 9 out of 10 of the header files referenced.

= Your locks? =
 * *Lock1*: I assume is a straight-ahead CAS lock
 * *Lock2*: Bakery algorithm?
 * *Lock3*: You mention Anderson, but not 100% sure which of his algorithms it is
