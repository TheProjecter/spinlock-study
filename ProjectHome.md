This is the repo. for a course project for a graduate level operating systems course at the University of Toronto.  It seeks to implement a wide variety of popular spin-lock algorithms appearing in the research literature (in Java and C++), and to develop microbenchmarks to evaluate these implementations on a wide variety of target platforms.  Disclaimer: this is only a course project, and it is unlikely to be professional quality work.
